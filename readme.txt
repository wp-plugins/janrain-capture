Janrain Registration and Customer Profile Data Storage

== Description ==

Janrain makes it easy to know your customers and personalize every interaction. Our Customer Profile Management Platform helps companies build a unified view of their customers across all devices by collecting accurate customer profile data to power personalized marketing. The platform encompasses social login, registration, customer profile data storage, customer insights, single sign-on, and user-generated content.

This plugin accelerates the deployment of Janrain Registration on your WordPress site. This plugin requires a Janrain Registration account.

Janrain Registration is a customizable registration and profile system that offers  default screens and workflows to optimize the user experience around sign-up and improve data quality. Registration includes in-line field verification, email confirmation, password reset, and other advanced registration features.

Janrain Registration was previously named Janrain Capture. The plugin UI references this legacy name.

== Short Codes ==
To insert Janrain Registration links in posts or pages use the shortcode: [janrain_capture]

By default, [janrain_capture] will result in a link with the text "Sign in / Register" that will launch a modal window pointing to your Registration signin screen. You can customize the text, action, and starting width/height of the modal window by passing in additional attributes. The following is an example of a link to the legacy_register screen with a height of 800px and a width of 600px:

[janrain_capture text="Register" action="legacy_register" width="600" height="800"]

You can prevent the construction of the link and simply return the URL to the screen by adding the attribute href_only="true" to the shortcode.

To insert links in your theme templates you can use the [do_shortcode](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/do_shortcode) WordPress function.

This plugin supports Janrain Social Sharing v2 via the Social Login (Engage) application configured for your account. To use this feature, ensure 'Enable Social Sharing' is checked in the UI Options administration page and use the [janrain_share] shortcode. If the $post object is available the title, description, URL, and the most recent attached image URL will automatically be determined for sharing. These variables, as well as the button text, can be overridden with the following shortcode attributes:

* title
* description
* url
* img
* text

Example:
[janrain_share title="Janrain Engage Share Widget" description="Instructions for how to configure the Janrain Engage Share Widget" url="wordpress.org/extend/plugins/janrain-capture/" text="Tell a friend"]
